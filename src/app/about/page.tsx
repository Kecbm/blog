            Beyond the Code.

        Even before joining Trybe, I started researching on Twitter what it was like to work as a developer. Since then, I’ve been active in the “Bolha Dev” (Dev Bubble), a vibrant community where I continuously learn, share my journey, and connect with amazing people in the field.

        Being part of this community opened up incredible opportunities, including being interviewed by Globo, where I talked about my experience going through my first layoff.

        As a content creator on DEV Community, I write about career development, problem-solving, and personal growth in tech. I’ve published over 24 articles, with more than 12,200 views and 3,580 followers.

        My most impactful article documents everything that helped me quickly get back into the tech market after the layoff — and I had the honor of presenting its key takeaways at GitHub Brasil.

        I have seven pets: one pinscher and six cats. In my free time, I enjoy playing PS3, riding my bike, going to the gym, and maintaining a daily reading habit.
